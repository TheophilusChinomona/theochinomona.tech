name: Frontend Accessibility
description: Build accessible user interfaces following WCAG guidelines with semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and proper color contrast. Use this skill when creating or modifying UI components, implementing form inputs, adding interactive elements, working with navigation menus, creating modals or dialogs, or handling focus management. Apply when working on React component files (*.tsx, *.jsx), Shadcn/ui components, or any frontend code that users interact with. This skill ensures semantic HTML elements (nav, main, button, etc.) that convey meaning to assistive technologies, keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators (focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 in Tailwind), sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text), descriptive alt text for images and meaningful labels for form inputs, screen reader testing and verification, ARIA attributes for complex components when semantic HTML isn't sufficient, logical heading structure (h1-h6 in proper order), and proper focus management in dynamic content, modals, and SPAs.
